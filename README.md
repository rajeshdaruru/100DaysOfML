Today's Progress: Introduction to ML/AI. 

Artifical Intelligence: The study of how to make computers perform functions which at present humans are good at. 
Examples: Voice and Speech Recognization, Face recognization and face identofication, Object detection, Intuition, Inferencing, Learning new skills, Decision making, Abstract thinking 

Two types of AI - Artificial Intelligence:
  Strong AI, Full AI or General Intelligence
  Narrow AI, Weak AI or Applied AI(AAI)

Some terms in AI: 
  Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Big Data Analytics, Knowledge Discovery from Databases, and Data Science.
 
  ML is alogirthm part of AI, ML is set of algorithms that are implemented to achieve the intelligence. 
  Data Mining is collection of the steps, Collect the data, clean the data, format the data, analyize the data, apply algorithm on that data, test the algorithm, use the the data. 
  
Weak AI Examples: Amazon recommendtaions, Amazon's 'echo dot' and 'echo plus' voice recognition systems, telsa auto pilot, nissan pro assist auto, Pandora Internat Radio, Walmart Robots working store aisles - checking stocks
Strong AI: we don't have any Strong AI products yet. Broad AI is the ability to minic the cognitive functions of humans. 

Thougths: Its good to start reading about ML/AI

Today's Progress: Machine Learning Introduction
"A Computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with Experience E." - Tom Mitchell. 

A domain of ML is related to question of how to build computer programs that by themselves(automatically) improve or LEARN from experience.
